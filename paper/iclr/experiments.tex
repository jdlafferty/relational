% \footnotetext{We ran the experiments described here on RTX 2080ti, RTX 3090, and A100 GPUs, available to us through our institution's internal cluster.The models here are relatively small; powerful GPUs are not required to train a single model. We found the use of GPUs useful for evaluating learning curves over several trials.}
