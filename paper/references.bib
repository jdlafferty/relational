abstract = {Abstract Memristors, Flash, and related nonvolatile analog device technologies offer in-memory computing structures operating in the analog domain, such as accelerating linear matrix operations in array structures. These take advantage of analog tunability and large dynamic range. At the other side, content addressable memories (CAM) are fast digital lookup tables which effectively perform nonlinear Boolean logic and return a digital match/mismatch value. Recently, nonvolatile analog CAMs have been presented merging analog storage and analog search operations with digital match/mismatch output. However, CAM blocks cannot easily be inserted within a larger adaptive system due to the challenges of training and learning with binary outputs. Here, a missing link between analog crossbar arrays and CAMs, namely a differentiable content addressable memory (dCAM), is presented. Utilizing nonvolatile memories that act as a â€œsoftâ€ memory with analog outputs, dCAM enables learning and fine-tuning of the memory operation and performance. Four applications are quantitatively evaluated to highlight the capabilities: improved data pattern storage, improved robustness to noise and variability, reduced energy and latency performance, and an application to solving Boolean satisfiability optimization problems. The use of dCAM is envisioned as a core building block of fully differentiable computing systems employing multiple types of analog compute operations andÂ memories.},

Merolla et al. applied our present knowledge of the structure and function of the brain to design a new computer chip that uses the same wiring rules and architecture. The flexible, scalable chip operated efficiently in real time, while using very little power. Science, this issue p. 668 A large-scale computer chip mimics many features of a real brain. Inspired by the brainâ€™s structure, we have developed an efficient, scalable, and flexible nonâ€“von Neumann architecture that leverages contemporary silicon technology. To demonstrate, we built a 5.4-billion-transistor chip with 4096 neurosynaptic cores interconnected via an intrachip network that integrates 1 million programmable spiking neurons and 256 million configurable synapses. Chips can be tiled in two dimensions via an interchip communication interface, seamlessly scaling the architecture to a cortexlike sheet of arbitrary size. The architecture is well suited to many applications that use complex neural networks in real time, for example, multiobject detection and classification. With 400-pixel-by-240-pixel video input at 30 frames per second, the chip consumes 63 milliwatts.}}

The account presented here suggests that memories are first stored via synaptic changes in the hippocampal system, that these changes support reinstatement of recent memories in the neocortex, that neocortical synapses change a little on each reinstatement, and that remote memory is based on accumulated neocortical changes. Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences. The hippocampal system permits rapid learning of new items without disrupting this structure, and reinstatement of new memories interleaves them with others to integrate them into structured neocortical memory systems.},

	abstract = {A growing literature suggests that the hippocampus is critical for the rapid extraction of regularities from the environment. Although this fits with the known role of the hippocampus in rapid learning, it seems at odds with the idea that the hippocampus specializes in memorizing individual episodes. In particular, the Complementary Learning Systems theory argues that there is a computational trade-off between learning the specifics of individual experiences and regularities that hold across those experiences. We asked whether it is possible for the hippocampus to handle both statistical learning and memorization of individual episodes. We exposed a neural network model that instantiates known properties of hippocampal projections and subfields to sequences of items with temporal regularities. We found that the monosynaptic pathway—the pathway connecting entorhinal cortex directly to region CA1—was able to support statistical learning, while the trisynaptic pathway—connecting entorhinal cortex to CA1 through dentate gyrus and CA3—learned individual episodes, with apparent representations of regularities resulting from associative reactivation through recurrence. Thus, in paradigms involving rapid learning, the computational trade-off between learning episodes and regularities may be handled by separate anatomical pathways within the hippocampus itself.

	abstract = {The quintessential memory system in the human brain-the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe-is often treated as a module for the formation of conscious, or declarative, memories. However, growing evidence suggests that the hippocampus plays a broader role in memory and cognition and that theories organizing memory into strictly dedicated systems may need to be updated. We first consider the historical evidence for the specialized role of the hippocampus in declarative memory. Then, we describe the serendipitous encounter that motivated the special section in this issue, based on parallel research from our labs that suggested a more pervasive contribution of the hippocampus to cognition beyond declarative memory. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework that describes 2 general mechanisms for how the hippocampus interacts with other brain systems and cognitive processes: the memory modulation hypothesis, in which mnemonic representations in the hippocampus modulate the operation of other systems, and the adaptive function hypothesis, in which specialized computations in the hippocampus are recruited as a component of both mnemonic and nonmnemonic functions. This framework is consistent with an emerging view that the most fertile ground for discovery in cognitive psychology and neuroscience lies at the interface between parts of the mind and brain that have traditionally been studied in isolation.},

This paper introduces the flattened butterfly, a cost-efficient topology for high-radix networks. On benign (load-balanced) traffic, the flattened butterfly approaches the cost/performance of a butterfly network and has roughly half the cost of a comparable performance Clos network.The advantage over the Clos is achieved by eliminating redundant hopswhen they are not needed for load balance. On adversarial traffic, the flattened butterfly matches the cost/performance of a folded-Clos network and provides an order of magnitude better performance than a conventional butterfly.In this case, global adaptive routing is used to switchthe flattened butterfly from minimal to non-minimal routing - usingredundant hops only when they are needed. Minimal and non-minimal, oblivious and adaptive routing algorithms are evaluated on the flattened butterfly.We show that load-balancing adversarial traffic requires non-minimalglobally-adaptive routing and show that sequential allocators are required to avoid transient load imbalance when using adaptive routing algorithms.We also compare the cost of the flattened butterfly to folded-Clos, hypercube,and butterfly networks with identical capacityand show that the flattened butterfly is more cost-efficient thanfolded-Clos and hypercube topologies.},
