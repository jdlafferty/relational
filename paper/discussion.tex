    \caption{In a more general architecture, motivated by principles of information processing 
    in the brain, the relational cross attention mechanisms can be regulated by a controller, and bindings between encoder/decoder and abstractor states are maintained in episodic memory. This allows abstract states---e.g., emergent symbols---to be shared and reused across problems and domains. When Encoder/Decoder states appear together repeatedly through experience and replay, the abstract inference circuit can be preempted by a direct connection (gray arrow), leading to computational efficiency and parallelization (i.e., consolidation and automatization).
