We would like to extend our thanks to all reviewers for taking the time to engage with our work and provide feedback.

We made several additions to the paper since initial submission that we'd like to share with you. We've uploaded the updated pdf. In particular, we would like to draw your attention to the following:
- We've extended the Abstractor framework by proposing several "symbol assignment" mechanisms, with different properties. This is described in section 2.3 "Symbol Assignment Mechanisms." As you know, the first step in the Abstractor algorithm is to "assign a symbol to each object." In the previous version of the paper, we considered what we are now calling "positional symbols," where symbols are assigned to objects sequentially based on the order they appear. While very simple, this method has the advantage of strictly obeying the relational bottleneck and it works well in practice (i.e., in our experiments). In section 2.3, we propose two other symbol assignment mechanisms: position relative symbols (which we mentioned in the previous version of the paper as well), and "symbolic attention". Symbolic attention enables symbols to represent information about the object's 'role', which can be shared across problem instances. That is, the symbol identifies an object in relational cross-attention based on its role, rather than only its position.
- We've added added an evaluation of an Abstractor model with symbolic attention as its symbol-assignment mechanism to section 4.3 (the math experiments). In the previous version, we compared an Abstractor with positional symbols to a standard Transformer, and observed modest but consistent improvements. The Abstractor with symbolic attention yields a further improvement.
- We've included additional baselines to the discriminative relational tasks experiments (section 4.1). In particular we've added PrediNet and MLP baselines.

We hope you will look at these additions and provide any additional comments or questions you have. We look forward to interesting discussions over the next few days.
