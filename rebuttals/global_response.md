We would like to extend our thanks to all reviewers for taking the time to read our work and provide feedback. We look forward to interesting discussions over the next few days.

We believe your feedback and suggestions have already improved the paper. We would like to draw your attention to the update version of the paper in which we've added the following:
- Additional baselines to the discriminative relational tasks experiments. In particular we've added PrediNet and MLP baselines.
- The new appendix section on visualizing the geometry of learned representations. [[TODO add this]]
